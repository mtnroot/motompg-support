    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Mountain Root, LLC ("Mountain Root," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the MotoMPG mobile application and related services (the "Service").</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information that you provide to us directly, information collected automatically when you use the Service, and information from service providers acting on our behalf.</p>
    <h3>1) Account Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Display name (optional)</li>
      <li>Firebase user identifier (UID)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2) User Content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Motorcycle records (bikes), trips, fill-ups, notes, and related metadata you create in the app</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3) Identifiers and App Activity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>App/installation identifiers (e.g., Firebase Installations ID)</li>
      <li>Basic app activity and timestamps needed to operate the Service (e.g., sign-in/sign-out, content creation time)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4) Diagnostics (only if enabled in a future version)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Crash and performance data to improve reliability. If we add a crash/performance SDK (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics), we will update this policy and our App Store privacy disclosure accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">We do not collect the advertising identifier (IDFA) and we do not track users across other companies’ apps or websites.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core functionality of the Service (sign-in, create/edit bikes, trips, fill-ups)</li>
      <li>Sync and back up your data across devices for subscribers</li>
      <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the Service (including customer support)</li>
      <li>Communicate important updates or policy changes</li>
      <li>Enforce our Terms of Use and protect the Service against fraud, abuse, or misuse</li>
      <li>Comply with applicable laws and regulations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance of a contract (to provide the Service you request)</li>
      <li>Our legitimate interests (e.g., to secure and improve the Service)</li>
      <li>Your consent (where required by law)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share information only as described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use trusted third parties to host, store, and process data on our behalf (e.g., Google Firebase for authentication and database). These providers are contractually obligated to process data only as instructed by us and not for their own purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal and Safety:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mountain Root, our users, or the public.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to this policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Firebase acts as our data processor/service provider. For details on Firebase’s privacy practices, see: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Tracking and Advertising</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not use IDFA.</li>
      <li>We do not link your data with third-party data for advertising or measurement across other companies’ apps or websites.</li>
      <li>We do not share data with data brokers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If this changes in the future, we will update this policy and our App Store privacy disclosure and, where required, request your permission.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. If you delete your account, we will delete or de-identify your personal data within a reasonable period, subject to legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed and stored in the United States and other countries where our service providers operate. By using the Service, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to jurisdictions with data protection laws that may differ from those in your location.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access, Update, Delete:</strong> You can update your display name in-app. You can delete your account in-app (Profile &gt; Delete Account) which removes your personal data from our systems, subject to legal obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> We may send you important service or policy updates. If we send optional communications (e.g., tips), you can opt out as instructed in those communications.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform Settings:</strong> You may control certain permissions and analytics preferences at the OS level (e.g., iOS Settings).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are in the EEA/UK, you may have additional rights under applicable data protection laws (e.g., right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object, and data portability). To exercise these rights, contact us.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
