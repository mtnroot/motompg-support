    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the MotoMPG mobile application and related services (the "Service"), provided by Mountain Root, LLC ("Mountain Root," "we," "us," or "our"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview of the Service and Plans</h2>
    <p>MotoMPG helps riders log fill-ups, track fuel economy, and review their riding history.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free Plan:</strong> Limited to one (1) bike, up to three (3) fill-ups per bike, and one (1) trip. Deleting bikes to circumvent these limits is not permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>Premium Subscription ("MotoMPG Premium"):</strong> Enables expanded features such as cloud backup &amp; sync, unlimited logs, multi-device history, and priority processing. Features may evolve over time. Details and current pricing are shown in-app and on the App Store product page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may modify plan features or limits from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you in-app or via an update.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction) to use the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activities under your account. You agree to provide accurate information and to keep it up to date.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions, Billing, and Renewal</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Auto-Renewing Subscription:</strong> Premium is an auto-renewing subscription billed through Apple’s App Store. Your subscription renews automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> The price and period (e.g., yearly) are displayed in-app and on the App Store product page. Prices may change; if they do, Apple will generally notify you per their policies, and you can accept the new price or cancel.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment and Receipts:</strong> Payment is charged to your Apple ID at the time of purchase. You can view and manage your subscription, including cancellation, in your Apple ID settings: <em>Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; Subscriptions</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel, your access to Premium features continues until the end of the current billing period. We do not issue refunds for partial periods. For refunds, please contact Apple Support as purchase processing is handled by Apple.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Free Plan Usage</h2>
    <p>The free plan is intended for basic use and evaluation. You agree not to circumvent or attempt to circumvent plan limits (e.g., deleting bikes to add more beyond the free cap). We may adjust free plan limits or features at any time.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use and Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service in any unlawful manner or for any unlawful purpose</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers/networks connected to the Service</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or other users’ data</li>

    <p>You retain ownership of content you create (e.g., bikes, trips, fill-ups, notes). You grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, and display your content solely to operate and improve the Service.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
